<h2 id="ghost-themes">Ghost themes</h2><p>Ghost comes with a default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes.</p><p>If you need something a little more customised, it's entirely possible to build on top of existing open source themes, or to build your own from scratch. Rather than giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.</p><h2 id="marketplace">Marketplace</h2><p>There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can download from the <a href="https://ghost.org/marketplace/">Ghost Theme Marketplace</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/marketplace.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme with some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS</figcaption></figure><h2 id="theme-development">Theme development</h2><p>Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a set of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. For example: <code>{{author.name}}</code> outputs the name of the current author.</p><p>The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper">the source code for Casper</a>, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.<br></p><ul><li><code>default.hbs</code> is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.</li><li><code>post.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing a post.</li><li><code>index.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.</li><li>and so on</li></ul><p>We've got <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/">full and extensive theme documentation</a> which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use. You can also get started with our useful <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter/">starter theme</a>, which includes the most common foundations and components required to build your own theme.</p><blockquote>If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a <strong>themes</strong> section on our <a href="https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes">public Ghost forum</a>.</blockquote>
